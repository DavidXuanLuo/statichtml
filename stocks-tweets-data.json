Grok: response 显示更多 if there is something persistently wrong with the driver after the Tesla automatically pulls over: does the Vehicle recognize that & either self-alert Paramedics or self-drive to the Hospital & alert them to the problem? 由 Grok 回答 19 网页 The Tesla vehicle, when using Full Self-Driving (FSD), employs a driver monitoring system with cabin cameras to detect if the driver is unresponsive or inattentive. If the system identifies persistent issues—such as the driver not responding to escalating alerts (visual cues, audio chimes, and steering wheel prompts)—it will activate hazard lights, slow the vehicle down, and attempt to pull over to the shoulder or come to a complete stop in a safe manner, depending on the software version and surrounding conditions. However, the vehicle does not automatically alert paramedics or emergency services in response to driver incapacitation alone. Automatic emergency calling (eCall or similar) is typically triggered only by severe collisions, airbag deployment, or manual activation via the touchscreen SOS icon, and even this varies by region (e.g., required in the EU but not standard in the US). It also does not autonomously navigate to a hospital without user input; any such navigation would require the driver or a passenger to set the destination in the navigation system while FSD is engaged. In the specific incident you referenced, the driver's wife manually alerted emergency services using a location-sharing app, and the vehicle drove to the hospital only after paramedics revived the driver enough for him to provide input, with FSD handling the driving to the pre-set destination. 显示更多 自己去问 Grok 1 33",
