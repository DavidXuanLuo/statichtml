Just Mention Them. @elonmusk @Tesla @UNEP \" Renewable energy and EVs- the breakthrough scale to minimize greenhouse gas pollution.\" @AL Gore @Tesla @China EVs @Globally EVs deployment @Unep @WHO @FAO @Eric98122385 由 Grok 回答 Renewable energy combined with the rapid global deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in scaling solutions to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution, particularly from the transportation and power sectors. Transportation is a major source of emissions, and shifting to EVs—especially when charged with clean electricity—dramatically cuts lifecycle GHG output compared to gasoline or diesel vehicles. Recent analyses show that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in regions like the EU have lifecycle emissions around 73% lower than gasoline cars on average grids, rising to 78% lower with renewable-dominated electricity. Globally, EVs already avoid substantial emissions through efficiency gains (e.g., 80–90% energy conversion to motion vs. 15–25% for internal combustion engines), and tools like optimized charging can further reduce grid emissions from EVs by up to 18% annually (or over 90% on clean days). The breakthrough comes from synergies: Renewables (solar, wind, etc.) are now the cheapest new electricity sources, with 93% of new global generation in 2025 coming from renewables. Battery costs are plummeting (doubling production yearly), enabling massive scaling. This powers EVs while decarbonizing the grid, creating a virtuous cycle—more renewables mean cleaner EV charging, and more EVs drive demand for clean power. Global EVs deployment is accelerating rapidly. In 2025, over 20 million electric cars were sold worldwide (about 25% of total car sales), up sharply from prior years. The global EV fleet is growing toward hundreds of millions by 2030, avoiding gigatons of CO₂. Emerging markets (beyond China/Europe) are \"leapfrogging\" with strong growth in places like Southeast Asia and Brazil. China EVs lead decisively—over 50% EV sales share in 2025 (plugins at 54%), with BEVs alone at 33%. China produced ~70% of global EVs, exported massively, and dominated battery supply (e.g., CATL at 39%). This has driven global momentum, though domestic growth slowed slightly into 2026 amid market saturation and policy shifts. @AL Gore has emphasized this unstoppable transition. At Davos in early 2026, he noted renewables are \"taking over\" with no choice but to embrace them—solar/wind costs are crashing, batteries too, and the U.S./world can't opt out without falling behind. He highlighted clean tech's momentum despite policy challenges. Organizations like @UNEP actively support electric mobility in the Global South (over 60 countries, $130M+ in grants), focusing on two/three-wheelers and light-duty vehicles to curb transport's rising emissions (projected to double by 2050 without action). @WHO links this to air pollution health benefits (EVs reduce local pollutants), while @FAO ties energy-smart food systems to renewables and efficiency for broader GHG cuts (food systems contribute ~20%+ of emissions). Overall, this scale—renewables powering EVs at record adoption rates—is already slowing emissions growth (e.g., clean tech avoided ~2.6 Gt CO₂ annually by 2024, preventing worse rises). Full potential requires continued grid decarbonization, infrastructure, and policies, but the trajectory shows EVs + renewables as a core path to net-zero. This is the breakthrough at scale we're witnessing. 显示更多 自己去问 Grok 6",

Just Mention Them. @elonmusk @Tesla @UNEP \" Renewable energy and EVs- the breakthrough scale to minimize greenhouse gas pollution.\" @AL Gore @Tesla @China EVs @Globally EVs deployment @Unep @WHO @FAO @Eric98122385 由 Grok 回答 Renewable energy combined with the rapid global deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in scaling solutions to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution, particularly from the transportation and power sectors. Transportation is a major source of emissions, and shifting to EVs—especially when charged with clean electricity—dramatically cuts lifecycle GHG output compared to gasoline or diesel vehicles. Recent analyses show that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in regions like the EU have lifecycle emissions around 73% lower than gasoline cars on average grids, rising to 78% lower with renewable-dominated electricity. Globally, EVs already avoid substantial emissions through efficiency gains (e.g., 80–90% energy conversion to motion vs. 15–25% for internal combustion engines), and tools like optimized charging can further reduce grid emissions from EVs by up to 18% annually (or over 90% on clean days). The breakthrough comes from synergies: Renewables (solar, wind, etc.) are now the cheapest new electricity sources, with 93% of new global generation in 2025 coming from renewables. Battery costs are plummeting (doubling production yearly), enabling massive scaling. This powers EVs while decarbonizing the grid, creating a virtuous cycle—more renewables mean cleaner EV charging, and more EVs drive demand for clean power. Global EVs deployment is accelerating rapidly. In 2025, over 20 million electric cars were sold worldwide (about 25% of total car sales), up sharply from prior years. The global EV fleet is growing toward hundreds of millions by 2030, avoiding gigatons of CO₂. Emerging markets (beyond China/Europe) are \"leapfrogging\" with strong growth in places like Southeast Asia and Brazil. China EVs lead decisively—over 50% EV sales share in 2025 (plugins at 54%), with BEVs alone at 33%. China produced ~70% of global EVs, exported massively, and dominated battery supply (e.g., CATL at 39%). This has driven global momentum, though domestic growth slowed slightly into 2026 amid market saturation and policy shifts. @AL Gore has emphasized this unstoppable transition. At Davos in early 2026, he noted renewables are \"taking over\" with no choice but to embrace them—solar/wind costs are crashing, batteries too, and the U.S./world can't opt out without falling behind. He highlighted clean tech's momentum despite policy challenges. Organizations like @UNEP actively support electric mobility in the Global South (over 60 countries, $130M+ in grants), focusing on two/three-wheelers and light-duty vehicles to curb transport's rising emissions (projected to double by 2050 without action). @WHO links this to air pollution health benefits (EVs reduce local pollutants), while @FAO ties energy-smart food systems to renewables and efficiency for broader GHG cuts (food systems contribute ~20%+ of emissions). Overall, this scale—renewables powering EVs at record adoption rates—is already slowing emissions growth (e.g., clean tech avoided ~2.6 Gt CO₂ annually by 2024, preventing worse rises). Full potential requires continued grid decarbonization, infrastructure, and policies, but the trajectory shows EVs + renewables as a core path to net-zero.
