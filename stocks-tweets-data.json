Of course i still believe vision over Lidar hybrid systems will win…but important to keep stats in perspective here. Long both $TSLA and $googl Can you give me crashes per autonomous mile or km driven by company? 由 Grok 回答 As of mid-February 2026 (current date: February 18, 2026), normalized crash rates for unsupervised/fully autonomous operations (ADS - Automated Driving Systems) vary significantly by company due to differences in fleet scale, operational maturity, reporting thresholds, and definitions of a \"crash\" (NHTSA requires reporting even minor property-damage-only incidents involving ADS). The raw NHTSA ADS crash counts referenced in recent discussions (e.g., the chart from @wholemars) show Tesla with ~14 incidents, Waymo with far higher absolute numbers (often cited around 1,200–1,600+ cumulative, though exact latest tallies fluctuate with updates), and Cruise much lower (around 155 cumulative). However, raw counts don't account for exposure (miles driven), which is essential for fair comparison. Key Estimates for Crashes per Million Autonomous Miles (or Equivalent) These are approximate, based on public reports, NHTSA filings, company statements, and media analyses as of early 2026. Note: Definitions vary (e.g., police-reported, property damage only, at-fault vs. any involvement; some include low-speed stationary incidents). Waymo (Alphabet): Cumulative fully driverless miles: 200 million (widely reported as \"nearly 200 million\" or \"over 200 million\" by February 2026, up from 127 million through late 2025). Crashes per million miles: Roughly 6–8 (or ~125,000–167,000 miles per crash). Waymo consistently reports better-than-human performance in their safety impact studies (e.g., 78–90% fewer injury crashes vs. human benchmarks in operating cities), though NHTSA counts include many minor/rear-end incidents where the Waymo vehicle was stopped and not at fault. Tesla (Robotaxi pilot, primarily Austin; unsupervised FSD operations): Cumulative unsupervised/autonomous robotaxi miles: 700,000–800,000 (extrapolated from Q4 2025 earnings 700k through late 2025, plus early 2026 growth; some trackers estimate ~500k–800k total by February). Crashes (NHTSA ADS reports): ~14 since June 2025 launch. Crashes per million miles: Roughly 17–20 (or ~50,000–57,000 miles per crash). Many incidents are very low-speed (e.g., <10 mph backing/parking lot or fixed-object contacts), with no fatalities and minimal injuries reported. This rate is several times higher than average human drivers (~1 police-reported crash per 500,000 miles), though the pilot remains small-scale with recent unsupervised expansion. Cruise (GM): Cumulative fully driverless miles: Limited recent public figures (historically ~10+ million driverless miles pre-2023 pause; operations scaled back significantly after 2023 incidents, with supervised testing resuming in limited areas by 2026). Crashes (NHTSA ADS): ~155 cumulative. Crashes per million miles: Higher historically during peak operations (pre-pause estimates often worse than Waymo), but current normalized rate is unclear due to reduced scale and fleet activity. Less data available for 2026. Important Caveats Normalization matters hugely — Waymo's higher absolute crash count reflects vastly more miles driven (hundreds of times Tesla's pilot scale) across multiple mature cities with no safety drivers. Tesla's pilot is newer, smaller, and Austin-focused. Crash severity — Most reported incidents across companies are minor (property damage only, low/no injury). Fatality/injury rates remain extremely low for all. Comparability issues — NHTSA data includes any ADS-involved crash (even if not at fault), and thresholds differ from company self-reported stats. Human benchmark: 2 crashes per million miles overall, but 1 police-reported per ~0.5–1 million miles depending on source. Rapid changes — These figures evolve quickly (e.g., Tesla improving with updates; Waymo scaling to 4M+ miles/week fleet-wide). For the absolute latest, check NHTSA's Standing General Order crash reporting page or company safety reports. In summary, on a normalized basis (crashes per autonomous mile), Waymo currently leads with the lowest rate among major players with large-scale unsupervised ops, while Tesla's early pilot shows a higher (but improving?) rate in a much smaller deployment. Cruise lags in recent visibility due to past setbacks. 显示更多 自己去问 Grok 1 23",
